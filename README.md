# Chit Chat

Chit Chat is a full-stack chat application that leverages the power of Node.js, React.js and ChatEngine.io to provide a seamless chatting experience.

## Overview
Chit Chat enables users to engage in real-time conversations with their friends through a user-friendly interface. It incorporates features like group chats and image sharing to enhance the communication experience. For the backend of my application, I have chosen to use Node.js and Express. These technologies provide a robust and scalable foundation for handling server-side logic and API development. To store and manage my chat data, I am utilizing the powerful features of ChatEngine.io. ChatEngine.io offers convenient APIs specifically designed for hosting chats, making it an ideal choice for my project. On the frontend, I used React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. To streamline the development process and enhance the user interface, I incorporated pre-built Chat UI components offered by ChatEngine.io. These components serve as free building blocks for creating intuitive and visually appealing chat user interfaces.
